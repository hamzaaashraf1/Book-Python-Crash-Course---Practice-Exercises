# Whenever we change the value of a variable, Python 
# will keep track of its current value

    # NAMNG VARIABLES

# only letters, numbers and underscores
# no spaces, only underscores
# no staring with numbers, omly with alphabets
# no use of python function names as variable names
# should be be short and descriptive


message = "Hello Python Crash Course reader!"
# print(mesage) will give error b/c of wrong spellings
 # the interpreter provides a traceback when the
  # program cannot run successfully
  # traceback is a record of where the interpreter
  # ran into trouble while execution

# How variables work?
# Variables are not boxes that you can store values
# in, rather they are labels that you assign to 
# values. "A variavbles REFRENCES a certain value."
